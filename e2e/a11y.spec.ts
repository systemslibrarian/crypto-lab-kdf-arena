/**
 * WCAG A/AA regression gate. Deploys are already gated on the KDF correctness
 * claims in `claims.spec.ts`; this gates them on accessibility the same way.
 *
 * Four configurations — {dark, light} x {1280, 380} — because a single-theme,
 * single-viewport scan covers one quarter of what ships, and which quarter
 * depends on defaults nobody asserted. Each configuration opens both
 * disclosures, presses both "Weaken" presets, benchmarks at minimum and at
 * shipped cost, toggles the memory chart's log scale, drives the attacker rig
 * to both ends of its range, and walks both salt branches — scanning after
 * every step. See `gate.ts` for why nothing is injected into the page, why each
 * scan asserts its content first, and why `violations` is not the whole oracle.
